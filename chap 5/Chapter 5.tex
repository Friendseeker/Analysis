\section*{The real numbers}
\subsection*{5.1 Cauchy sequences}
\subsubsection*{Definition 5.1.1 (Sequences).}
Let $m$ be an integer. A sequence $(a_n)_{n=m}^{\infty}$ of rational numbers is any function from the set $\{n\in\mathbf{Z}:n\geq m\}$ to $\mathbf{Q}$, i.e.,
a mapping which assigns to each integer $n$ greater than or equal to $m$, a rational number $a_n$. More informally, a sequence $(a_n)_{n=m}^\infty$ of rational 
numbers is a collection of rationals $a_m$, $a_{m+1}$, $a_{m+2},\dotsc$
\subsubsection*{Definition 5.1.3 ($\varepsilon$-steadiness).}
Let $\varepsilon>0$. A sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ is said to be $\varepsilon$-steady iff each pair $a_j,a_k$ of sequence elements is $\varepsilon$-close for 
every natural number $j,k$. In other words, the sequence $a_0,a_1,a_2,\dotsc$ is $\varepsilon$-steady iff $|a_j-a_k|\leq\varepsilon$ for all $j,k$.
\subsubsection*{Definition 5.1.6 (Eventual $\varepsilon$-steadiness).}
Let $\varepsilon>0$. A sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ is said to be eventually $\varepsilon$-steady iff the sequence $a_N,a_{N+1},a_{N+2},\dotsc$ is $\varepsilon$-steady 
for some natural number $N\geq 0$. In other words, the sequence $a_0,a_1,a_2,\dotsc$ is eventually $\varepsilon$-steady iff there exists an $N\geq 0$ such that 
$|a_j-a_k|\leq\varepsilon$ for all $j,k\geq N$.
\subsubsection*{Definition 5.1.8 (Cauchy sequences).}
A sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ of rational numbers is said to be a Cauchy sequence iff for every rational $\varepsilon>0$, the sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ is 
eventually $\varepsilon$-steady. In other words, the sequence $a_0,a_1,a_2,\dotsc$ is a Cauchy sequence iff for every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists an $N\geq 0$
such that $d(a_j,a_k)$ for all $j,k\geq N$.
\subsubsection*{Proposition 5.1.11}
The sequence $a_1,a_2,a_3,\dotsc$ defined by $a_n:=1/n$ (i.e., the sequence $1,1/2,1/3,\dotsc$) is a Cauchy sequence. 
\subsubsection*{Definition 5.1.12 (Bounded sequences).} 
Let $M\geq 0$ be rational. A finite sequence $a_1,a_2,\dotsc,a_n$ is bounded by $M$ iff $|a_i|\leq M$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$. An infinite sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$
is bounded by $M$ iff $|a_i|\leq M$ for all $i\geq 1$. A sequence is said to be bounded iff it is bounded by $M$ for some rational $M\geq 0$.
\subsubsection*{Lemma 5.1.14 (Finite sequences are bounded).}
Every finite sequence $a_1,a_2,\dotsc, a_n$ is bounded.
\subsubsection*{Lemma 5.1.15 (Cauchy sequences are bounded).}
Every Cauchy sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is bounded.
\subsubsection*{Exercise 5.1.1}
Prove Lemma 5.1.15.
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence. So for $\varepsilon=1$, there exists an $N\geq 1$ such that $d(a_j,a_k)\leq 1$ for all
    $j,k\geq N$. Then the sequence can be splite into two parts: $a_1,\dotsc,a_N$ and $a_{N+1},a_{N+2},\dotsc$. The former is a finite sequence, by Lemma 5.1.14, 
    it is bounded. Suppose this finite sequence is bounded by $M_1$. Consider $a_{N+1},a_{N+2},\dotsc$. Since it is $1$-steady, for any $i>N+1$, we have 
    $|a_i-a_{N+1}|\leq 1$. Rearrange the inequalities, we have $a_{N+1}-1\leq a_i\leq a_{N+1}+1$. Let $M_2=a_{N+1}+1$. Then $a_{N+1}<M_2$ and for every $i>N+1$, we have 
    $a_i\leq M_2$. So sequence $a_{N+1},a_{N+2},\dotsc$ is bounded by $M_2$. Let $M=\max\{M_1,M_2\}$. Then the Cauchy sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$
    is bounded by $M$. 
\end{proof}
\subsection*{5.2 Equivalent Cauchy sequences}
\subsubsection*{Definition 5.2.1 ($\varepsilon$-close sequences).}
Let $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ be two sequences, and let $\varepsilon>0$. We say that the sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ is $\varepsilon$-close 
to $(b_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ iff $a_n$ is $\varepsilon$-close to $b_n$ for each $n\in\mathbf{N}$. In other words, the sequence $a_0,a_1,a_2,\dotsc$ is $\varepsilon$-close
to the sequence $b_1,b_1,b_2,\dotsc$ iff $|a_n-b_n|\leq\varepsilon$ for all $n=0,1,2,\dotsc$.
\subsubsection*{Definition 5.2.3 (Eventually $\varepsilon$-close sequences).}
Let $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ be two sequences, and let $\varepsilon>0$. We say that the sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ is eventually $\varepsilon$-close 
to $(b_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ iff there exists an $N\geq 0$ such that the sequences $(a_n)_{n=N}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=N}^\infty$ are $\varepsilon$-close. In other words,
$a_0,a_1,a_2,\dotsc$ is eventually $\varepsilon$-close to $b_0,b_1,b_2,\dotsc$ iff there exists an $N\geq 0$ such that $|a_n-b_n|\leq\varepsilon$ for all $n\geq N$.
\subsubsection*{Definition 5.2.6 (Equivalent sequences).}
Two sequences $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ are equivalent iff for each rational $\varepsilon>0$, the sequences $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ and 
$(b_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ are eventually $\varepsilon$-close. In other words, $a_0,a_1,a_2,\dotsc$ and $b_0,b_1,b_2,\dotsc$ are equivalent iff for every for every rational $\varepsilon>0$,
there exists an $N\geq 0$ such that $|a_n-b_n|\leq\varepsilon$ for all $n\geq N$.
\subsubsection*{Proposition 5.2.8}
Let $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be the sequences $a_n=1+10^{-n}$ and $b_n=1-10^{-n}$. Then the sequences $a_n$, $b_n$ are equivalent.
\subsubsection*{Exercise 5.2.1}
Show that if $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ are equivalent sequences of rationals, then $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence if and only if $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$
is a Cauchy sequence.
\begin{proof}
    Assume $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ are equivalent sequences of rationals, and $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence. We want to show that for any rational 
    $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $N\geq 1$ such that $b_N,b_{N+1},\dotsc$ is $\varepsilon$-steady. 

    Since $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence and $\frac{\varepsilon}{3}>0$, there exists $N_1\geq 1$ such that for all $i,j\geq N_1$, $|a_i-a_j|\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{3}$.
    Since $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ are equivalent, and $\frac{\varepsilon}{3}>0$, there exists $N_2\geq 1$ such that for all $i\geq N_2$, $|b_i-a_i|\leq\frac{\varepsilon}{3}$.
    Let $N=\max\{N_1,N_2\}$. Consider arbitrary $i,j\geq N$. Since $N\geq N_1$, we have 
    \begin{equation*}
        |a_i-a_j|\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{3}.
    \end{equation*}
    Since $N\geq N_2$, we have
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{gathered}
            |b_i-a_i|\leq\frac{\varepsilon}{3}
        \end{gathered}
    \end{equation*}
    and 
    \begin{equation*}
        |a_j-b_j|\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{3}.
    \end{equation*}
    Since 
    \begin{equation*}
        |a_i-a_j|\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{3}
    \end{equation*}
    and 
    \begin{equation*}
        |b_i-a_i|\leq\frac{\varepsilon}{3},
    \end{equation*}
    we have 
    \begin{equation*}
        |b_i-a_j|\leq |a_i-a_j|+|b_i-a_i|\leq\frac{\varepsilon}{3}+\frac{\varepsilon}{3}=\frac{2\varepsilon}{3}.
    \end{equation*}
    Since 
    \begin{equation*}
        |a_j-b_j|\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{3}
    \end{equation*}
    and 
    \begin{equation*}
        |b_i-a_j|\leq\frac{2\varepsilon}{3},
    \end{equation*}
    we have 
    \begin{equation*}
        |b_i-b_j|\leq|a_j-b_j|+|b_i-a_j|\leq\frac{\varepsilon}{3}+\frac{2\varepsilon}{3}=\varepsilon.
    \end{equation*}
    Thus, for any $\varepsilon>0$, we can find $N=\max\{N_1,N_2\}$ such that $b_N,b_{N+1},dotsc$ is $\varepsilon$-steady. Therefore, $(b_n)_{i=1}^\infty$
    is a Cauchy sequence. 

    Similarly, we can show that if $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ are equivalent sequences of rationals and $(b_n)_{i=1}^\infty$ is 
    a Cauchy sequence, then $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence. Thus, if $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ are equivalent sequences of rationals, then $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence if and only if $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$
    is a Cauchy sequence.
\end{proof}
\subsubsection*{Exercise 5.2.2}
Let $\varepsilon>0$. Show that if $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ are eventually $\varepsilon$-close, then \an is bounded if and only if \bn is bounded.
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ are eventually $\varepsilon$-close and \an is bounded. Since $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ are eventually $\varepsilon$-close,
    for any $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $N\geq 1$ such that for any $i\geq N$, $|a_i-b_i|\leq\varepsilon$. Consider an arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$. We can find $N\geq 1$ such that for any 
    $i\geq N$, $|a_i-b_i|\leq \varepsilon$. Then 
    \begin{equation*}
        a_i-\varepsilon\leq b_i\leq a_i+\varepsilon.
    \end{equation*}
    Split \bn to $b_1,\dotsc,b_{N}$ and $b_{N+1},b_{N+2},\dotsc$. The former is a finite sequence, so it is bounded by some rational number $M_1$. Since \an is bounded, there exists $M$ such that $|a_i|\leq M$ for all $i\geq 1$. Then 
    \begin{equation*}
        -M\leq a_i\leq M.
    \end{equation*}
    So
    \begin{equation*}
        -M-\varepsilon\leq b_i\leq M+\varepsilon.
    \end{equation*}
    Therefore, $|b_i|\leq M+\varepsilon$ for all $i\geq N+1$. Let $M_0=\max(M,M_1)$. For any $i\geq 1$, we have $|b_i|\leq M_0$. Thus, \bn is bounded. 

    Similarly, we can show that if $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ are eventually $\varepsilon$-close, and \bn is bounded, then \an is bounded.

    Thus, if $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ are eventually $\varepsilon$-close, then \an is bounded if and only if \bn is bounded. 
\end{proof}
\subsection*{5.3 The construction of the real numbers}
\subsubsection*{Definition 5.3.1 (Real numbers).}
A real number is defined to be an object of the form \la, where \la is a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers. Two real numbers \la and \lb are said to be equal iff 
\an and \bn are equivalent Cauchy sequences. The set of all real numbers is denoted $\mathbf{R}$.
\subsubsection*{Proposition 5.3.3 (Formal limits are well-defined).}
Let $x=$ \la, $y=$ \lb, and $z=$ \lc be real numbers. Then, with the above definition of equality for real numbers, we have $x=x$. Also, if $x=y$, then $y=x$.
Finally, if $x=y$ and $y=z$, then $x=z$.
\subsubsection*{Definition 5.3.4 (Addition of reals).}
Let $x=$ \la and $y=$ \lb be real numbers. Then we define the sum $x+y$ to be $x+y:=$ \lab.
\ssc{Lemma 5.3.6 (Sum of Cauchy sequences is Cauchy).}
Let $x=$ \la and $y=$ \lb be real numbers. Then $x+y$ is also a real number (i.e., $(a_n+b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence of rationals).
\ssc{Lemma 5.3.7 (Sums of equivalent Cauchy sequences are equivalent).}
Let $x=$ \la, $y=$ \lb, and $x'=$ LIM$_{n\to a_n'}$ be real numbers. Suppose that $x=x'$. Then we have $x+y=x'+y$.
\ssc{Lemma 5.3.9 (Multiplication of reals).}
Let $x=$ \la and $y=$ \lb be real numbers. Then we define the product $xy$ to be $xy:=$ LIM$_{n\to\infty}a_n b_n$.
\ssc{Proposition 5.3.10 (Multiplication is well defined).}
Let $x=$ \la, $y=$ \lb, and $x'=$ LIM$_{n\to\infty}a_n'$ be real numbers. Then $xy$ is also a real number. Furthermore, if $x=x'$, then $xy=x'y$.
\ssc{Proposition 5.3.11}
All the laws of algebra from Proposition 4.1.6 hold not only for the integers, but for the reals as well.
\ssc{Definition 5.3.12 (Sequences bounded away from zero).}
A sequence \an of rational numbers is said to be bounded away from zero iff there exists a raional number $c>0$ such that $|a_n|>c$ for all $n\geq 1$.
\ssc{Lemma 5.3.14.}
Let $x$ be a non-zero real number. Then $x=$ \la for some Cauchy sequence \an which is bounded away from zero.
\ssc{Lemma 5.3.15.}
Suppose that \an is a Cauchy sequence which is bounded away from zero. Then the sequence $(a_n^{-1})_{n=1}^\infty$ is also a Cauchy sequence.
\ssc{Definition 5.3.16 (Reciprocals of real numbers).}
Let $x$ be a non-zero real number. Let \an be a Cauchy sequence bounded away from zero such that $x=$ \la. Then we define the reciprocal $x^{-1}$ by the formula
$x^{-1}:=$ LIM$_{n\to\infty}a_n^{-1}$. 
\ssc{Lemma 5.3.17 (Reciprocation is well defined).}
Let \an and \bn be two Cauchy sequences bounded away from zero such that \la = \lb (i.e., the two sequences are equivalent). Then \lao = \lbo.
\ssc{\E 5.3.1.}
Prove Proposition 5.3.3.
\begin{proof}
    Reflexivity. Since $x=$ \la, \an is a Cauchy sequence. Obviously, \an and \an are equivalent. Therefore, \la = \la ($x=x$).

    Symmetry. Assume $x=y$, then Cauchy sequences \an and \bn are equivalent. So for every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $N\geq 1$ such that for every $i\geq N$, 
    $|a_i-b_i|=|b_i-a_i|\leq\varepsilon$. Therefore, \bn and \an are equivalent. Thus, \lb = \la ($y=x$).

    Transitivity. Assume $x=y$ and $y=z$. We want to show that the Cauchy sequences \an and \cn are equivalent, that is, 
    for any $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $N\geq 1$ such that for all $i\geq N$, we have $|a_i-c_i|\leq \varepsilon$. Suppose $\varepsilon$ is an arbitrary positive rational number.
     Since $x=y$, the Cauchy sequences \an and \bn are equivalent. Then there exists $N_1$ such that for every $i\geq N_1$, we have $|a_i-b_i|\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$.
     Since $y=z$, the Cauchy sequences \bn and \cn are equivalent. Then there exists $N_2$ such that for every $i\geq N_2$, we have $|b_i-c_i|\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$.
     Let $N=\max(N_1,N_2)$, then for all $i\geq N$, $|a_i-c_i|\leq |a_i-b_i|+|b_i-c_i|\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2}+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\epsilon$. Thus, \an and \cn are equivalent. 
     So $x=z$.
\end{proof} 
\ssc{\E 5.3.2}
Prove Proposition 5.3.10.
\begin{proof}
    $xy$ is a real number. We want to show that for any $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $N\geq 1$ such that $|a_i b_i-a_j b_j|\leq\varepsilon$ for any $i,j\geq N$. Consider an 
    arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$. Since \an and \bn are Cauchy sequences, by Lemma 5.1.15, they are both bounded. Assume \an is bounded by $M_1$ and \bn is bounded by $M_2$. Since $a_n$ is a Cauchy sequence, there exists $N_1\geq 1$ such that
    for all $i,j\geq N_1$, we have 
    \begin{equation*}
        |a_i-a_j|\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2M_1}.
    \end{equation*} 
    Similarly, since \bn is a Cauchy sequence, there exists $N_2\geq 1$ such that for all $i,j\geq N_2$, we have 
    \begin{equation*}
        |b_i-b_j|\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2M_2}.
    \end{equation*}
    Let $N=\max(N_1,N_2)$, consider an arbitrary pair of $i,j\geq N$. Then we have 
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            |a_j b_j-a_i b_i|&=|a_j b_j-a_j b_i+a_j b_i-a_i b_i|\\
            &\leq |a_j b_j-a_j b_i|+|a_j b_i-a_i b_i|\\
            &=|a_j|\cdot |b_j-b_i|+|b_i|\cdot |a_j-a_i|\\
            &\leq M_1\cdot \frac{\varepsilon}{2M_1}+M_2\cdot\frac{\varepsilon}{2M_2}\\
            &=\frac{\varepsilon}{2}+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\\
            &=\varepsilon.
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}
    Therefore, for every $\varepsilon>0$, we can find an $N=\max(N_1,N_2)$ such that $a_N b_N,a_{N+1}b_{N+1},\dotsc$ is $\varepsilon$-close. Thus, $(a_n b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$
    is a Cauchy sequence and $xy$ is a real number.

    Since \bn is a Cauchy sequence, it must be bounded by some rational number $M$. Since \an and $(a_n')_{n=1}^\infty$ are equivalent, for every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $N\geq 1$ such that 
    for all $i\geq N$, we have 
    \begin{equation*}
        |a_i-a_i'|\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{M}.
    \end{equation*}
    Therfore, for all $i\geq N$, 
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            |a_i b_i-a_i' b_i|&=|b_i|\cdot |a_i-a_i'|\\
            &\leq M\cdot \frac{\varepsilon}{M}\\
            &=\varepsilon.
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}
    Thus, $(a_n b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(a_n' b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ are equivalent and that $xy=x'y$. 
\end{proof}
\ssc{\E 5.3.3}
Let $a,b$ be rational numbers. Show that $a=b$ if and only if \la = \lb (i.e., the Cauchy sequences $a,a,a,a,\dotsc$ and $b,b,b,b,\dotsc$ are equivalent if and only if $a=b$).
This allows us to embed the rational numbers inside the real numbers in a well-defined manner.
\begin{proof}
    Suppose the Cauchy sequences $a,a,a,a,\dotsc$ and $b,b,b,b,\dotsc$ are equivalent. Assume $a\ne b$, then $|a-b|>0$. Since the two sequences are equivalent, for every $\varepsilon>0$,
    there exists $N\geq 1$ such that $|a_i-b_i|\leq \varepsilon$. Let $\varepsilon=\frac{|a-b|}{2}>0$. Then no matter what value $i$ is, we have 
    \begin{equation*}
        |a_i-b_i|=|a-b|>\frac{|a-b|}{2}=\frac{\varepsilon}{2}
    \end{equation*}
    which contradicts the definition of equivalent sequences. Therefore, $a=b$.

    Suppose $a=b$. Then for any $\varepsilon>0$, let $N=1$, we have 
    \begin{equation*}
        |a_i-b_i|=|a-b|=0<\varepsilon
    \end{equation*}
    for all $i\geq N$. Therefore, \an and \bn are equivalent.

    Thus, $a=b$ if and only if \la = \lb.
\end{proof}
\ssc{\E 5.3.4}
Let \anz be a sequence of rational numbers which is bounded. Let \bnz be another sequence of rational numbers which is equivalent to \anz. 
Show that \bnz is also bounded.
\begin{proof}
    Suppose \anz is bounded by $M$. Similar to Exercise 5.2.2, we can split \bn to $b_0,\dotsc,b_N$ and $b_{N+1},b_{N+2},\dotsc$ such that the former is bounded by some rational number $M_1$ and 
    the latter is bounded by $M+\varepsilon$ for any $\varepsilon>0$. Let $M_0=\max(M,M_1)$, then \bnz is bounded by $M_0$. 
\end{proof}
\ssc{\E 5.3.5}
Show that LIM$_{n\to\infty}1/n=0$. 
\begin{proof}
    We want to show that $a_n=1/n$ and $0,0,0,\dotsc$ are equivalent. Consider an arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$. Let $N=\lceil\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\rceil$, we have 
    \begin{equation*}
        |a_i-0|=a_i\leq a_N=\frac{1}{N}\leq \varepsilon
    \end{equation*}
    for all $i\geq N$. 
    Thus, LIM$_{n\to\infty}1/n=0$. 
\end{proof}
